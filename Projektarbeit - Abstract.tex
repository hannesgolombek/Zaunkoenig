\noindent In the scope of this student research project a model half-wing of the aircraft “Zaunkönig” will be constructed scaled down to 1:4.7 as a glass fibre spar structure. The wing will be construed for strength and bending stiffness using analytical methods as far as possible, completed by numerical methods. The computing programs ABAQUS and $ eLamX^{2} $ will be used in assistance. Afterwards a short manual to manufacture the wing is presented. For a simulated test with an eccentric load the mass, breaking load, shear center and lowering as well as torsion of the tip of the wing will be determined. Under special consideration of the weight normalized strength criterion the wing will be rated in relation to comparative data and the calculated values critically analyzed.
