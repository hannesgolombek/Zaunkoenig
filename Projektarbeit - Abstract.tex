\noindent In this project work a model halve wing of the aircraft “Zaunkönig” will be constructed scaled down 1:4.7 as a glass fiber spar structure. The wing will be construed for strength and bending stiffness using analytical methods as much as possible, completed by numerical methods. The Programs ABAQUS and $ eLamX^{2} $ will be used in assistance. Afterward a short manuel to build the wing is given. For a simulated test with an eccentric force the mass, breaking load, shear center and as well lowering as torsion of the tip of the wing will be determined. Under special consideration of the weight normalized strength criterion the wing will be rated in relation to comparison data and the calculated values critically analyzed.
